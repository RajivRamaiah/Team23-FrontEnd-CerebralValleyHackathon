| Action | Lesson Response  / Why It Is Wrong | Criteria from Log File |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Bomber (**B1**) ahead of the fighters (**MADDOG)** | OCA (MADDOG) should be ahead of the Strike Package to provide protection.  |  |
| Blue Fighters (**MADDOG)** turned away from Red Air with no Blue Fighters currently pointed at them  | Turning cold (away from the Red Air) removes your ability to maintain radar coverage and offensive flow.  |  |
| Blue Fighters (**MADDOG)** not “Commited” (player presses Commit button) by 80 miles after Red Air is detected | Delaying committing on Red Air allows Red to gain an advantage in flow and delays your shots.  |  |
| Player puts Protected Entity Protection Zone (PEPZ) too close to Red threats (60 miles) | Placing your PEPZ too close to threats puts them in danger and gives Blue Air less room to maneuver.  |  |
| Player sets **MADDOG** “Weapons Usage” to “Tight” with 20 red entities. | Weapons tight prevents Blue AIr from taking initial shots that will shape the picture by attriting Red Air.  |  |
| Player commits HOSS flight  (F15EX) first instead of SATAN, SCAT, or BONG.  | The stealth abilities of 5th Generation aircraft makes it the preferred choice to shape the initial picture.  |  |
| Player sets **B1 “**engagement level” to Offensive. | The Strike Package should remain cautious and spin (turn around) as required to maintain distance from Red Air.  |  |

**Player Tasks and Expected Flow** (Notional Distances)

Player places the initial Fighter CAP.  
Player places the initial Bomber PEPZ.

*Start Mission* 

*Phase 1: Air-to-Air Engagement*

Player moves fighters towards their CAP.  
Player ensures fighters remain “hot” or pointed towards the expected Red Air.   
Player moves bombers towards their CAP.  
If Red Air is detected and within 100 miles, player should “Commit” on Red Air and shoot.  
Players should select a 5th Generation Aircraft (F-35 \[callsign BONG or SCAT\] or F-22 \[callsign SATAN\]) to initially target Red Air aircraft.   
If there are multiple groups of Red Air, player should target more than one “Group” of Red Air, players should target the different groups if they are in azimuth (East \- West). 

If the groups are oriented in range (North \- South), the player should put range or “defense-in-depth” between the MADDOG fighters; i.e., commit SATAN and BONG or SCAT. 

\[*Phase 2: Air-to-Surface Attack:*  
*Once all enemy Red Air are destroyed (Doghouse with number 0), the situation is now “PICTURE CLEAN,” meaning no Red Air are remaining and the player can begin their bomber attack.*\]  
Player sets MADDOG escort package is in an orbit over or just south of the enemy spawn points.  
Player keeps the MADDOG escort package between any potential Red Air and the bomber.   
Player instructs the bomber to begin engaging the ships. 

\[*Phase 3: Egress*  
*After all ships are destroyed, this is called “MILLER TIME.” It means the bomber should now RTB.*\]  
Player commands Bomber to RTB.  
Player keeps MADDOG escort package between potential Red Air and the Bomber. 

**Notional Tactics Manual** 

Mission Planning

Planners should consider the location of their Combat Air Patrol (CAP) points. CAP points should be set at a range that allows Blue fighters time to commit on Red Air, allowing them sufficient time to detect, target, and identify all factor enemy groups. 

Planners should establish a Protected Entity Protection Zone (PEPZ) for their strike package. This area is a zone for the strike package to hold during the air-to-air engagement. A strike package generally consists of a bomber aircraft that has no or limited self-protection against Red enemy fighters. The PEPZ should be sufficient distance from the fighter CAP to ensure that Red Air is unable to target the strike package. A general rule-of-thumb (ROT) is 100 nautical miles (NM)from the Fighter CAP. 

All CAPs should be placed outside of the threat rings of Red surface-to-air (SAM) missile systems located on land or on naval vessels. If the threat ring of an entity is unknown, hold at 50 NM from the entity. If untargeted, consider moving to 25 NM while taking a defensive posture. 

High-Value Airborne Assets (HVAA) are airborne assets whose loss would significantly disadvantage Blue forces. An example HVAA is the AWACS, an airborne command and control platform that provides radar coverage and surveillance that is transmitted to Blue forces. 

HVAAs should be placed in an orbit outside the fight zone. 

Planners should consider a multi-phased approach with criteria to move onto the next phase. For example, in Phase 1, Blue forces defeat the initial Red Air and 

Fighter Escort Tactics

Multiple aircraft can serve in an escort role, including the F-15EX, F-35, and F-22. The F-22 is the primary air-to-air platform and is a 5th Generation aircraft along with the F-35. 5th Generation aircraft have significant advantages in being low observable or “stealthy” compared to 4th Generation aircraft like the F-15EX. 

Targeting: Blue Air should first engage Red Air based on their “factor” or threat to operations. Red Fighters are the number one targeting priority for Blue Air, followed by Red C2/HVAA aircraft. 

Tactics: Blue fighters should attempt to attrit the “initial picture” or first appearing amount of enemy Red contacts. If Blue fighters outnumber the enemy 2-to-1, they should continue on an offensive flow. 

Geometry: If Red fighters are oriented in azimuth, Blue fighters should target both groups. A group is defined as all aircraft within 3 nautical miles. If Red fighters are oriented in range (e.g., a “North Group” 15 nautical miles behind a “South Group”), Blue fighters should commit to target the leading edge (South Group) with additional Blue fighters remaining behind by 15 to 30 nautical miles. This can be done by commanding short trail, medium trail, or long trail formation positions. It is important to have at least some Blue fighters always pointed “downrange” at the Red Air CAPs and potential spawn points. This increases radar coverage and situational awareness of the air picture. 

If Red Air maneuvers and turns cold (away from Blue) or Blue fighters have a 2:1 ratio against Red Air, a Wall formation can be use

Shots: Blue fighters should be “Weapons Free,” allowing aircrew to shoot Red Air if they meet enemy criteria. If Red fighters equal the number of AMRAAMs (primary air-to-air missile for Blue fighters), the mission commander should consider 

Bomber Tactics

Bombers can employ a variety of weapons. For this scenario, the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile can be employed against Red warships. 

Electronic Attack Tactics

The EA-18G Growler has electronic warfare and jamming that can be used to target Red forces. Package the EA-18G with the strike package. 

HVAA Defense

If Red fighters approach within 150 miles of a HVAA, the HVAA should “SLIDE” and adjust its orbit farther from the fight. If the Red fighters approach within 100 miles of the HVAA, it should “SCRAM” and egress with a focus on survival over accomplishing the mission. 

Integrated OCA/Strike Package  
Integrating escort aircraft with the strike package is of critical importance to mission success or failure. The fighter escort will ensure the survivability of the strike package. Blue fighters can engage in an “offensive counter-air” (OCA) sweep of Red Air before the strike package “pushes” from their marshal point (pre-defined area) within the PEPZ.
