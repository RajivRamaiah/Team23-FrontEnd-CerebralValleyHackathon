          The E-3 AWACS detected the threat just inside the CAP's fighter screen
          at 150 NM. This allowed for timely defensive reactions to neutralize
          the inbound enemy fighters and protect the strike package.

          Committing the entire MADDOG package to counter the detected threat
          was the right call. It ensured the enemy fighters were neutralized
          quickly to allow the strike to proceed unimpeded. Offensive counter
          air is a key mission for the fighter escort.

          The B-1 strike package successfully neutralized the enemy surface
          combatants, achieving a key mission objective. This was enabled by the
          fighter sweep eliminating air threats, allowing the bomber to engage
          undefended.

          With the primary objectives achieved and no further threats detected,
          ordering all assets to RTB was prudent. This minimizes the risk of
          attrition from undetected threats. Recovering high-value assets like
          AWACS and bombers is a priority.

      <strong>Mission Objective Assessment:</strong><br />
      Based on the Mission End log entry, the trainee successfully achieved all
      mission objectives with no Blue losses. The strike package neutralized the
      enemy surface combatants and all Blue assets safely returned to base,
      including the high-value AWACS. Overall, this represents an optimal
      outcome for the scenario.
